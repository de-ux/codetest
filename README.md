### Instructions

Build a functioning to-do list using the screenshots provided as a guide. 

Ground rules:

* You may build it using whatever you want, just make sure it looks and acts like the one in the screenshots. (Hint: you're applying for a front end developer job.)
* There's no need to save data in a database.
* You can look up stuff on the Google but don't ask others for help. 
* Please make it your own, but if you "borrow" anything from another example make sure you credit it.
* Be prepared to explain and account for all bits of code.

Basic functionality:

* 'Add' button should highlight on input keypress (todo-step2.png)
* Input value should be added to list when 'return' key is pressed
* Check icon should display on checkbox mouseover (todo-step4.png)
* To-do item should be removed when checkbox is checked

Dimensions: 

* width 400px
* min-height 300px

To get started:

1. Fork this repo 
2. Create a new folder for your stuff
3. Do your work
4. Submit a Pull Request when you're ready

Notes:

I built this without frameworks because I believe this is a good demonstration of my understanding of the fundamentals.  I have worked with frameworks and tools such SASS, Bootstrap, AngularJS and Angular 4, and Gulp - I just feel like if you understand the fundementals the frameworks come much easier.  I could build out this app in Angular if you preferred. 

I wanted to really make this an accessible application.  This is difficult and I wasn't successful in the limited time frame I have to work on thise, but I was thinking about this from the beginning.  Linked below are several sights that I used and drew CSS code from in order to try and replicate the accessible styles.  This is something I do typically -- looking at other design systems like Clarity, or at other developer advocates like Heydon Pickering or Marcy Sutton, for accessibility guidance in design and development.  If I had more dedicated time - I'd like to work on implementing focus throughout the application.

I also use the site CSS Comb to help organize my CSS code.  I prefer to group like items versus alphabetical organization.  My brain can find the code better -- however I'm sure I can follow whatever system is required for organization. I also run the code through an Autoprefixer to add vendor prefixes.
